Here is the description (edited by myself) of the movie file from the student:


XML file of just over 3000 movies.  All the movies are guaranteed the following:

Movie Title, Year Released, User Rating (out of 10), Actor[s] (minimum 1, maximum 5), Director, Genre Designation (minimum 1, maximum multiple genres), Running Time

For most of the movies I tried to get the rating certification, i.e. the thing that says whether a film is G, PG, PG13, etc.  The rating certification is based on the USA system.

The list has films dating back to at least the 1930s and will span all the potential genres.


The tags for this file are:

<movielist> </movielist> This encapsulates the entire document

<movie> </movie> This signals a specific movie

The following are encapsulated in between movie tags:

<title></title>

 <year></year> 

<actor></actor> 

<certification></certification>

<rating></rating>

<time></time>

<genre></genre>

<director></director>
